### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, Apache Web Server is dependent on Request Handling, Resource Management, and Logging and Monitoring. Similarly, Request Handling relies on Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs) and Request Metrics for efficient processing.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Resource Management depending on CPU Usage, Memory Usage, and Disk I/O and Usage, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
