### Services
Apache monitoring encompasses several specialized services, each targeting specific aspects of server performance:

1. Apache Web Server
    * Description: The primary component responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving web content.
2. Request Handling
    * Description: Manages the processing of incoming HTTP requests.
3. Resource Management
    * Description: Manages the allocation and usage of server resources such as CPU, memory, and disk.
4. Logging and Monitoring
    * Description: Handles the logging of server activities and monitoring of server performance.
5. Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs)
    * Description: Manages the configuration and performance of different MPMs like prefork, worker, and event.

### KPIs
Each service utilizes specific KPIs to measure its effectiveness:

1. Requests per Second
    * Description: Measures the number of requests handled by the server per second.
2. Request Latency
    * Description: Measures the time taken to process requests.
3. HTTP Errors
    * Description: Tracks the HTTP errors returned by the server.
4. CPU Usage
    * Description: Monitors the CPU utilization of the server.
5. Memory Usage
    * Description: Monitors the memory utilization of the server.
6. Disk I/O and Usage
    * Description: Monitors the disk read/write operations and disk space usage.
7. Access Logs
    * Description: Logs incoming requests to the server.
8. Error Logs
    * Description: Logs errors encountered by the server.
9. Prefork MPM
    * Description: Manages the configuration and performance of the prefork MPM.
10. Worker MPM
    * Description: Manages the configuration and performance of the worker MPM.
11. Event MPM
    * Description: Manages the configuration and performance of the event MPM.

### Relationships
#### Dependencies:
Services are interconnected; for instance, Apache Web Server is dependent on Request Handling, Resource Management, and Logging and Monitoring. Similarly, Request Handling relies on Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs) and Request Metrics for efficient processing.

#### Hierarchical Structure:
Some services form a hierarchy, such as Resource Management depending on CPU Usage, Memory Usage, and Disk I/O and Usage, illustrating a layered approach to performance monitoring where base metrics support broader performance indicators.
